# AEDSI - Practical Works

Practical work that we did at UFV during graduation, in the first period of 2021 (pandemic season).

The main programming language used is C.

In this repository there are basic concepts of the language, as well as:

•<a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abstract-data-types/">
  Abstract Data Type</a> (concept and implementation)

• <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/">
     Dynamic allocation</a>

• <a

     Linked lists</a>

• <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/">
     Queue</a>

• <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure-introduction-program/">
     Stack</a>

• <a

     Execution time measure</a>

• <a
href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/lectures/lec19-asymp/review.html">
     Asymptotic complexity</a>

• <a
href="https://lamfo-unb.github.io/2019/04/21/Sorting-algorithms/">
     Sorting algorithms</a>

The main reason for disclosing this repository is to help students learn C language, ordering methods and asymptotic complexity.
